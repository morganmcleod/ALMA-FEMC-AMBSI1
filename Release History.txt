RELEASE/REVISION HISTORY

2023-10-16  001.002.009
    Based on 1.2.5 (contains no changes from 1.2.6, 1.2.7, 1.2.8)
    EPP_MAX_TIMEOUT 2000 clock cycles instead of 1000

2023-09-17  001.002.008
    Message Object 15 now checks if NEWDAT is set before processing.
    This fixes the serial number being sent randomly.

2023-08-24  001.002.007
    moved BUSOFF recovey code into amb.c library.  BUSOFF counter is now 0x30007

2023-01-03  001.002.006
    Merged from Alejandro Saez' version which recovers the CAN bus from BUSOFF conditions,
    based on checking the CAN status register in an interval timer handler.

2022-03-14  001.002.005 see FEND-40.04.03.03-0021-A-PRO for details
    Fixed a buffer overflow which happens during start-up:  Not enough speace was allocated
    in static CALLBACK_STRUCT idata cb_memory[8];
    Delete symbol FULL_HANDSHAKE and all the alternative code.
    Added handlers for several new monitor points:
    GET_TIMERS_RCA = 0x20020
    GET_TIMERS2_RCA = 0x20021
    GET_PPORT_STATE = 0x20023
    These are for debugging purposes only and have no impact on the main functionality of the firmware.
    Don't send responses to ALMA SW for monitor messages not initiated by ALMA SW (during startup.)
    Delete all "handshaking" from the parallel port link setup.  It was never working as intended anyway.
    Rename all pin definition variables to match the names and semantics as used in the ARCOM firmware. 
    Add a pin definition for nSelect, which was missing.

2018-10-01  001.002.000
    Removed DEBUG symbol.  Previously it was always defined, therefore meaningless.
    FULL_HANDSHAKE is always defined.  Implemented in macro IMPL_HANDSHAKE.
    Added separate counters and monitor messages to measure timing between AMBSI1 and ARCOM
    MAX_TIMEOUT=500, about 530 uS
    AMBSI1 to ARCOM link set up in main().  GET_SETUP_INFO is vestigial but still returns what it previously did.
    If a timeout occurs in a monitoring transaction, automatically retry once.
    If a second timeout occurs, don't return 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
